# Latent-Variable-Models
### Description: 
As part of my studies, there are a few files showing how to create both latent trait and class models for different types of data.

### Covered topics:
- The normal linear factor model: specification, maximum likelihood estimation by the EM algorithm, goodness of fit.

- Latent trait model with binary data: specification of logit/normit model and normit/normit model, model estimation by the E-M algorithm, goodness of fit.

- Latent trait model with polytomous and ordinal data: specification and parameter interpretation. The underlyng variable approach.

- Latent class model with binary data: specification, identifiability, maximum likelihood estimation, goodness of fit.

#### Remarks:
- To check the tasks solved in "Mock_exam.pdf" please check the file "mock_exam_tasks.pdf"
- in some cases dataset are not uploaded since they can be accessed right from the used packeges in the codes.
